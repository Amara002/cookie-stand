### Reflections and Comments

- *How did this go, overall?*

> *Everything went well.*

- *What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?*

> *It was clear*

- *How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?*

> *It took 5 hours from me. I think I will do that by 30 minutes.*
